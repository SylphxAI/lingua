minor: add setRequestLocale for implicit locale passing (like next-intl)

NEW API:
- `setRequestLocale(locale)` - Set locale once in layout, use everywhere
- `getRequestLocale()` - Get the set locale
- `rosetta.getTranslations()` - Now works without locale param if setRequestLocale was called

This provides a similar DX to next-intl while remaining Edge-compatible.
No need to pass locale through every component anymore.
